## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 26th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

Completed a this challenge using HTML and CSS, which enhanced my layout skills and boosted my confidence in web design. The project involves creating a detailed and visually appealing layout. The testimonial section in the second part of the challenge was particularly rewarding, offering a valuable opportunity to tackle more complex design elements and improve my attention to detail.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
